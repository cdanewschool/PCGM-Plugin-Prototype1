TATRC1-PCGM-Plugin-Prototype1
=============================
Parsons Institute for Information Mapping Canonic GUI Model (PCGM)

DESCRIPTION

A prototype created to demonstrate PCGM. PCGM is a model for a development acceleration tool that abstracts HL7. 

This project was developed using the NetBeans integrated development environment (IDE) and the Java Framework; JAXB’s XJC compiler Plugin, and sun.codemodel.
  
The plugin prototype is intended as a ‘throwaway’ prototype and not an ‘evolutionary’ prototype. Further development and analysis is required for a production ready solution.
